.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft. It consists of Framework class library and Common Language Runtime
It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability 
(each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment, 
known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, 
memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.

FCL provides user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, 
and network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their own source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. 
.NET Framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an 
integrated development environment largely for .NET software called Visual Studio.

object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
